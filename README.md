i implemented [negamax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/negamax) in C, as well as 3 games: [connect 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/connect_four), [ultimate tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ultimate_tic-tac-toe), & [sim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sim_(pencil_game)). so, you can play against the negamax algorithm in any of these 3 games.

this code contains the back-end for the AI in my iOS game: [zig zag zoe](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1222417649) (no longer on app store).

see the "[artwork](artwork)" folder for a video of the AI versus itself. here's a screenshot of how an AI-vs.-AI zig-zag-zoe game looks on the terminal:
