TODO (29DEC2016)
- finish z3_reset/z3_free
- rename heuristic_win to heuristic_max
- use int16_t instead of int????

to do list (new)
- double check all macros (definitions, function-like, etc.)
- finish game_play and game_rematch


to do list
- add checks that values are appropriate for all files (e.g, in connectn.c, nconnect cannot exceed nrows, etc.)
- polish play_again() in play-connectn.c (i.e., add more input checks)
- add count of times actually chosen by negamax_move in transpose_t
    - prefer move of (node_t best[]) that has been chosen least often
- after every best option of the root node is stored in the transposition table with a depth
    equal to the depth of the transposition table's entry for the root node, increase the default negamax search depth by 1

to do list (2017-03-02)
- fix whatever the problem was with the vector holding the moves in game_move
    - is it a systemic problem with `vector`?
    - or is it just a usage problem (e.g., freeing game_state while vector still holds node)
- color the mega block when printing

20170401) something is wrong with negamax, fisheryates, node_free_except, or game_move/zigzagzoe
